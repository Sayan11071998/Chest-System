# üöÄ Chest System ‚Äì Modular & Scalable Reward System for Unity

Welcome to my latest Unity project‚Äîa **fully modular and scalable Chest System**, inspired by mobile games like *Clash Royale*. This system isn't just about unlocking rewards‚Äîit's an architectural showcase that balances fun gameplay with powerful extensibility. üéÆ

## üåü Key Features & Functionality

### üé≤ Randomized Chest Generation
Each chest is generated with randomized properties (from **Common** to **Legendary**), bringing unpredictability and excitement to every session.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Timed Unlocking with a Twist
Chests use real-time countdowns to build anticipation. Players can either wait or spend **gems** to unlock instantly‚Äîintroducing strategy and choice into progression.

### üé® Dynamic UI Feedback
Chests transition through visual states‚Äî**Locked**, **Unlocking**, **Unlocked**, and **Collected**‚Äîeach with engaging animations and satisfying sound feedback.

### üì¶ Inventory & Reward Management
Players can manage their expanding inventory with ease. Rewards like **coins** and **gems** are delivered through delightful animations to enhance the user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architectural & Design Patterns

### üìë Model-View-Controller (MVC)
Separation of data, UI, and logic improves clarity, maintainability, and testability of the codebase.

### üß≠ Service Locator Pattern
A centralized `GameService` singleton ensures streamlined access to core systems, reducing coupling and simplifying dependency management.

### üîÑ State Machine
Robust handling of chest states ensures smooth transitions between different phases like **Locked**, **Unlocking**, **Unlocked**, etc.

### üì¢ Observer Pattern
Event-driven design enables clean communication across game components, making the system modular and scalable.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Object Pooling
Efficient use of object pooling minimizes instantiation overhead‚Äîcrucial for maintaining smooth mobile performance.

## üíª Unity & C# Enhancements

### üîó Interfaces & Enums
Type-safe and extensible system design to define chest behaviors, rarity types, and state handling.

### üìú ScriptableObjects for Configuration
Flexible, data-driven design lets you configure chest properties and reward tables directly from the editor.

### üß© Generics & Extension Methods
Reusable and flexible code components help keep everything DRY (*Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself*).

### ‚è≥ Coroutines & Tweening
Smooth, time-based effects and transitions for chest animations, countdowns, and UI feedback.

### üîß Custom Editor Tools
Custom inspectors and tools simplify data entry and speed up iteration during development.

### üé≠ Canvas Groups for UI Transitions
Professional-level UI transitions using canvas groups to create smooth fades and visibility control.

## üèóÔ∏è Software Engineering Best Practices

### üõ°Ô∏è SOLID Principles
Each class follows the Single Responsibility Principle, making it easy to extend, test, and maintain.

### üîå Dependency Injection
Loose coupling of components makes the system adaptable and easier to integrate new features.

### üì¶ Namespaces & Abstraction
Structured code organization using namespaces and interfaces ensures flexibility and scalability.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Personal Reflections

Creating this Chest System has been a blend of **gameplay design** and **software architecture**. I‚Äôve applied principles from enterprise software development to build a feature-rich system that‚Äôs fun to use and easy to expand.

The modular design opens the door for future ideas‚Äîthink loot tables, limited-time chests, or even player progression integrations.
