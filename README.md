# Advanced Chest System for Mobile Games

Welcome to the **Advanced Chest System** project—a modular, scalable Unity framework inspired by mobile hits like Clash Royale. This system is designed to enrich the in-game reward mechanics by introducing randomized chests, timed unlocking, gem-based speed-ups, animated UI feedback, and much more.

## Overview

The Advanced Chest System is built on the principles of modularity and clean software architecture, making it extremely extensible and easy to maintain. Whether you’re adding new chest types, enhancing UI elements, or expanding gameplay mechanics, this system provides a robust foundation for all your mobile game reward systems.

## Key Features

- **🎲 Randomized Chest Generation:**  
  Generate chests with varying rarities—Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary—to keep every game session unpredictable and engaging.

- **⏱️ Timed Unlocking with a Twist:**  
  Enjoy a real-time countdown for unlocking chests while providing players the option to use gems for an instant reward.

- **🎨 Dynamic UI Feedback:**  
  Visual states (Locked, Unlocking, Unlocked, and Collected) are complemented with engaging animations and sound effects, making every interaction feel lively and satisfying.

- **📦 Inventory & Reward Management:**  
  Manage rewards effortlessly with expandable inventory slots and visually appealing animations that make coin and gem collection a delightful experience.

## Architectural Patterns

This project leverages several proven design patterns to ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase:

- **📑 Model-View-Controller (MVC):**  
  Separates chest data, UI, and logic for a clean and modular approach.

- **🧭 Service Locator Pattern:**  
  Utilizes a singleton `GameService` for centralized access across different components, simplifying dependency management.

- **🔄 State Machine:**  
  Manages different chest states (Locked, Unlocking, Unlocked, Collected) to enable robust and predictable transitions.

- **📢 Observer Pattern:**  
  Implements event-driven communication to decouple game elements and enhance flexibility.

- **♻️ Object Pooling:**  
  Boosts performance by recycling GameObjects instead of instantiating new ones repeatedly, critical for mobile platforms.

## Unity-Specific Enhancements

The system also incorporates a range of Unity-specific techniques:

- **🔗 Interfaces & Enums:**  
  Enforce consistent state behaviors and type-safe definitions for chest properties.

- **📜 ScriptableObjects:**  
  Allow data-driven configurations that facilitate quick adjustments without modifying the code.

- **🧩 Generics & Extension Methods:**  
  Promote flexible and reusable code components that adhere to the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle.

- **⏳ Coroutines & Tweening:**  
  Implement smooth time-based operations and polished UI transitions to enhance the overall user experience.

- **🔧 Custom Editor Tools:**  
  Streamline chest data configuration within Unity’s editor for efficient workflow and iteration.

- **🎭 Canvas Groups:**  
  Ensure smooth and visually engaging UI transitions for a refined presentation.

## Software Engineering Best Practices

In addition to game features, this project is built with strong engineering principles:

- **🛡️ SOLID Principles:**  
  Each class handles a single responsibility to ensure clarity, testability, and ease of maintenance.

- **🔌 Dependency Injection:**  
  Encourages loosely coupled components, making the system highly adaptable and scalable.

- **📦 Logical Code Organization:**  
  Utilizes namespaces and extensive interfaces to ensure that expanding the system is straightforward and manageable.
